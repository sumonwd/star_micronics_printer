# Windows Platform Status for Star Micronics Printer Plugin

## Current Status: Not Supported ⚠️

The Windows platform is **not currently supported** by this Flutter plugin because the **StarIO10 SDK (StarXpand SDK) is only available for Android and iOS** platforms.

## Why Windows is Not Supported

Star Micronics provides different SDKs for different platforms:

- **Android/iOS**: StarIO10 SDK (StarXpand SDK) - Modern, cross-platform API
- **Windows**: StarPRNT SDK for Windows Desktop - Separate SDK with different API

The StarIO10 SDK, which this plugin is built around, does not have a Windows implementation. The existing Windows C++ plugin structure in this repository is a stub that was generated by Flutter's plugin template but cannot be fully implemented without a compatible SDK.

## Alternative Solutions for Windows

If you need Star Micronics printer support on Windows, you have the following options:

### Option 1: Use StarPRNT SDK for Windows Desktop (Recommended)

Star Micronics provides the **StarPRNT SDK for Windows Desktop**, which is a C# SDK that works on Windows 7, 8/8.1, 10, and 11.

**Details**:
- **Language**: C# (.NET Framework 3.5 or later)
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/star-micronics/StarPRNT-SDK-Windows-Desktop
- **Platforms**: Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11
- **Development Tool**: Visual Studio 2008 or later

**How to Use**:
1. Download the StarPRNT SDK from the GitHub repository
2. Reference the SDK libraries in your Windows application
3. Use the SDK's C# API to communicate with Star printers
4. Build a separate Windows app outside of Flutter, or
5. Create a method channel bridge from Flutter to a C# DLL (advanced)

### Option 2: Platform Channel with C# Wrapper (Advanced)

If you want to integrate Star printer support into your Flutter Windows app, you could:

1. Create a C# library using the StarPRNT SDK
2. Expose it as a COM object or native DLL
3. Call it from the Flutter Windows C++ plugin via COM interop or P/Invoke
4. Map the StarPRNT SDK API to match the StarIO10 API used by Android/iOS

**Note**: This approach is complex and requires:
- Expertise in C++, C#, and COM/P/Invoke
- Maintaining API compatibility between StarIO10 and StarPRNT
- Additional development and testing effort

### Option 3: Wait for Official StarIO10 SDK for Windows

Star Micronics may release a StarIO10 SDK for Windows in the future. Check their official resources:

## Current Plugin Behavior on Windows

When you attempt to use this plugin on Windows, all printer-related methods will return an error with the code `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED` and a descriptive message directing you to this README.

**Supported Methods**:
- `getPlatformVersion()` - Returns Windows version (e.g., "Windows 10+")

**Unsupported Methods** (return `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED` error):
- `searchPrinters()`
- `getStatus()`
- `print()`
- `printCommands()`
- `openCashDrawer()`

## Example Error Handling

When using this plugin in a cross-platform Flutter app, handle Windows appropriately:

```dart
import 'package:star_micronics_printer/star_micronics_printer.dart';
import 'dart:io' show Platform;

Future<void> searchForPrinters() async {
  // Check platform before calling
  if (Platform.isWindows) {
    print('Windows is not supported. Please use the StarPRNT SDK for Windows Desktop.');
    return;
  }

  try {
    final printers = await StarMicronicsPrinter.searchPrinters();
    print('Found ${printers.length} printers');
  } catch (e) {
    if (e.toString().contains('PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED')) {
      print('This platform is not supported');
    } else {
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

## Contributing

If you're interested in implementing Windows support using the StarPRNT SDK, contributions are welcome! Please note that this would be a significant undertaking due to the API differences between StarIO10 and StarPRNT.

**Steps to Contribute**:
1. Research the StarPRNT SDK API
2. Create a mapping between StarIO10 commands and StarPRNT equivalents
3. Implement a C# wrapper or COM interface
4. Integrate with the Flutter Windows C++ plugin
5. Test with actual Star Micronics printers on Windows
6. Submit a pull request with documentation
